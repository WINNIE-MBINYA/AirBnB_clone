# AirBnB_clone

## Description of the project.
### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**.
What we build here will be we will use during other projects i.e:
- HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, frontend integration and other projects.



## Description of the command interpreter
It give us the ability to manage the objects of our project through using the command-line interpreter. It works as the front-end for the time being, before we are able to use HTML and CSS to create a graphical user interface.

### How it works && How it works.
**The shell in interactive mode:**
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb)

$
```

**In non-interactive mode:**
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
